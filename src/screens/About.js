                For years, I attributed Art as the aperture of my passion, whether it was 
                drawing, acrylic painting, or playing guitar. It wasn't until I began to 
                learn web development that helped me process why I felt a passion towards art. 
                I realized that I enjoyed creating, building functionality, producing beauty, 
                and making something engaging or stimulating. Cause I also like putting 
                together new PCs, I enjoy making pizza, and I've even found residential/commercial 
                painting rewarding for a time. The scope of web development encapsulates the acts 
                that give fuel to my passion and I hope to develop a career as a software developer.

                end development, but I do consider myself a full stack developer with a notable 
                flair of front end skill and intend to continue to develop my skills in that direction. The theme of 
                my portfolio is versatility in design. I've taken several popular themes of the 
                last year and wanted to illustrate
